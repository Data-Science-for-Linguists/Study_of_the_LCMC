# Project Title: A Study of the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese
## Summary:
This project is going to about taking a closer look at the data in the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese (LCMC). This corpus is in the .xml format and I believe that it can be difficult to read or use for linguists who do not have technical computer skills or software to read .xml files. Due to this, I believe that transforming the data from this corpus into dataframes or something similarly accessible would be worthwhile. As it is now, the LCMC divides its data into two separate categories: Chinese characters and Pinyin (the romanization of Chinese). One of the goals of this project is to put the two side by side so that the pinyin is accessible along side the character it corresponds with. The LCMC also includes a very in depth catalogue of tags for each word, marking their part of speech. Another goal of this is to include the part of speech for each word along side the characters and pinyin. One final goal of this project, if feasible, would be to compare the data from the LCMC to other corpora such as FLOB and FROWN as one of the LCMC's main goals was to make this corpus the Chinese equivalent of the two previously mentioned corpora.
