# A Study of the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese
## Summary:
This project is going to about taking a closer look at the data in the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese (LCMC). This corpus is in the .xml format and I believe that it can be difficult to read or use for linguists who do not have technical computer skills or software to read .xml files. Due to this, I believe that transforming the data from this corpus into dataframes or something similarly accessible would be worthwhile. As it is now, the LCMC divides its data into two separate categories: Chinese characters and Pinyin (the romanization of Chinese). One of the goals of this project is to put the two side by side so that the pinyin is accessible along side the character it corresponds with. The LCMC also includes a very in depth catalogue of tags for each word, marking their part of speech. Another goal of this is to include the part of speech for each word along side the characters and pinyin.

The Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese is a corpus designed as a match for the FLOB and FROWN corpora for modern British and American English. It contains 15 categories ranging from news to fiction to government documents. A link to the download is provided [here](http://ota.ox.ac.uk/headers/2474.xml).
