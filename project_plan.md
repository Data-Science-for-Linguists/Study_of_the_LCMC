# Project Idea: A Reformatting and Study of the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese
## Summary
I would like to take a closer look at the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese and try to organize it further. Some of what I would like to do is take if from being an xml file and convert it to something more readable. To those who don't really understand computers or aren't familiar with reading xml, it can be a confusing task, especially if you are trying to collect data. Because of this, I think data like this would be easier to read in something like a Pandas dataframe. I plan to create dataframes for all 15 of the different topics in the corpus and include the pinyin side to side with the characters as well as possibly being able to include the parts of speech.

## Data collection
As stated above, I will be utilizing the data provided by the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese and will try to reorganize it to be more accessible to the average linguist.

## Analysis
I'm not entirely sure what I can do to analyze the data. Perhaps I could look at the different parts of speech and see what is more frequently used than in the English language. This corpus was created to be something similar to FLOB and FROWN corpora of modern British and American English, so it might be relevant to make comparisons.

## Presentation
For my presentation, I would most likely want to share the dataframes that I create and compare the original format to what I create. Perhaps I could also get feedback on how to make it even better. If I do get a chance to compare this corpus to other corpora, then I will try and share data that I gather from that as well.
